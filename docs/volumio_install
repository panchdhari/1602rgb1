Quick installation instructions

WARNING:  These instructions are only for the Raspdac V3 running Volumio 2.  If you are using a Raspdac V2 or any other combination of RPi, OLED, LCD, or distribution it will not work.  Also, it is largely untested.  YMMV.

Install the latest version of Volumio 2 (currently 2.282) onto your SD card

Before removing SD card from your computer, place file named 'ssh' in /boot.  This file does not need to contain any content.  It just needs to exist in order to enable the SSH daemon when Volumio gets booted.

Place the SD card into your RPi and boot

Log in to the RPi using SSH
ssh volumio@volumio.local (the default password is volumio)

Issue the following commands to install pydPiper
git clone https://github.com/dhrone/pydPiper
pydPiper/volumio_install.sh
(enter the root password)

A lengthy install process will now run...

When the install script stops executing in about 20 seconds pydPiper should start working.
